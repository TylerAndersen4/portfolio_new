        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Marketplace is a curated online collection of independent fashion designers. As consumers become more aware of the environmental and humanitarian costs of fast fashion, they're becoming increasingly interested in local and/or sustainable clothing.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Clothing production requires a huge amount of resources and chemicals. The current demand for low-cost and low-quality clothing comes at the expense of factory workers, cotton farmers, and the environment. These are just a few of the ways the apparel industry is damaging:</p>
          <ul class="list1">
            <li class="item1">Chemicals used to grow cotton in developing countries end up polluting local water supplies and are cancerous to the farmers who come into contact with them daily.</li>
            <li class="item1">Clothing made abroad means a larger carbon footprint when these clothes are shipped overseas to their markets.</li>
            <li class="item1">Low-quality clothing that is meant to deteriorate creates a wasteful (and profitable) cycle of buying and disposing.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Marketplace connects consumers to independent designers that they wouldn't discover in major online retailers. Shoppers can save their favorite pieces and designers to get updates when new items become available.</p>

For the MVP I decided to focus on <b>account creation</b>, <b>document creation</b>, <b>document organization</b>, and <b>file uploading</b>.

      <div class="conclusion-mkt-inner1">
        <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
        <p>The process of designing Marketplace was both rewarding and challenging. I had the opportunity to build a platform that I believe could truly make a difference in the world, all while learning more about how different retailers craft their digital experiences. So, after all of this, what were my main takeaways?</p>
        <ul class="next-steps">
          <li class="item1">Testing design ideas early on will save time later at the wireframe and visual design stage. To that end, I would have liked to have done more paper prototyping, but it was difficult for me to find participants.</li>
          <li class="item1">One of the most important things I learned during this process is the importance of solid user personas. User goals should align with the high priority user stories that appear on the platform, and user frustrations should be based on actual user interviews.</li>
          <li class="item1">It's hard to find the balance between minimal and overkill with branding. I learned during this process that it's helpful to start with a logo, and then let the color palette evolve from there. I actually had to iterate through two color palettes before I settled on something that worked.</li>
