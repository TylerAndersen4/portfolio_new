          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <!-- <hr> -->
          <p>Kreation wanted an MVP app to get a sense of where we would be able to take their digital presence in the future. This project was intended more as a showcase of visual design rather than a robust app experience. While the functionality is limited now, I designed the app with growth and scalability in mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-1">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <!-- <hr> -->
          <p>The brand is looking to expand its digital presence and wanted to start that process with a mobile app. Eventually, they would like the mobile app to translate into an in-store tablet experience for customers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-1">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The solution is an elegant, user-friendly mobile experience that maintains the Kreation visual style and brand voice. Users are able to view the entire menu for the to-go items in the Kreation store, and from there see the ingredients and health benefits for a given item</p>

      <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
      <p class="col-sm-9 bio-intro">Since I was working with an existing brand style, the range of visual design on this project was more limited. This framework forced me to be even more creative because I wanted to accomplish two goals simultaneously: <b>translate the existing brand style onto the app faithfully</b>, and <b>visually elevate the brand toward a more contemporary feeling.</b></p>

  <div class="container-fluid stories1">
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">After meeting with key stakeholders for the app, I wrote out the user stories for the app. I prioritized by high, medium, and low with the intention of using the high-priority stories for the MVP. Features such as account creation, favoriting, and purchasing items were important but required a lot of engineering work. For the high-priority stories, I chose things that were easy from both a design and engineering perspective.</p>

        <h2>Getting Ideas onto Paper</h2>
        <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">Now that the information architecture was outlined, I was ready to start sketching out different interfaces. I used the "4-up" method which is a way to quickly iterate on four different views of the same screen. The intention is to get out as many ideas as possible in a short amount of time. From this practice, I would pick the layout that best displayed the given information and would then iterate on this screen. Using pen and paper is a great way to quickly throw away design ideas in search of something more efficient and user-oriented.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">After getting my rough sketches out, I made more precise sketches that would ultimately turn into wireframes. The advantage of high-fidelity sketches is that these allowed me to get feedback from the engineer I was working with early on in the design process. Iterating on some of my designs based on his feedback allowed us to save time in the mockup and development stage.</p>

      <ul class="wireframes-mkt-ul col-sm-10 list2">
        <li class="item1">Users won't want to keep going into categories within categories. It would be more helpful to have more items available on a single screen.</li>

      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">The final Kreation product is a culmination of user research, testing, and visual design. After multiple iterations, I created an MVP product that solves the initial problem: connect consumers with the items they're looking for at Kreation. With the app, users will have the same experience as reading a label on a Kreation bottle or on a food item.</p>

          <li class="item1">Ability to see the entire menu from the opening page of the app. The initial experience of the app is visual and sensory, and invites users to explore the items.</li>
          <li class="item1">Branding that matches the existing Kreation style. I wanted users to have a cohesive experience between looking at a label in person and seeing the label on the app. I used the craft paper motif and warm tones in order to imitate the existing style.</li>
          <li class="item1">The app is designed with scalability in mind. While the functionality is simple right now, I created a design system that can easily be built upon in the future.</li>
