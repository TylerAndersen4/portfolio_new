          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h2>Crafting a logo.</h2>
          <p>The logo creation journey for Josh Lacoste was part of a design contest I entered on the platform 99Designs. Out of 80 competing designs, mine was ultimately selected as the winning design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview-1">
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <h2>From music to visuals.</h2>
          <p>I was attracted to this project because of its unique challenge: how can a muscial style be converted into a logo? Josh is a future house electronic DJ based in Tokyo. In the project brief, he listed a few DJs that his audience listens to. With my headphones on, this gave me the initial direction for the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <h2>A unique logo for a new musician.</h2>
          <p>The final design channels to energy and emotion of house music. As an added bonus, the logo is easily adaptable to video, making it a dynamic asset for a new DJ.</p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <h2>Looking to other artists</h2>
      <p>A musician's logo is unique in that it needs to stand in the background of the artist's music. The logo shouldn't overpower their music, but instead should be a symbol for what the listener can expect. I looked at musicians that Josh pointed to in his brief: Odesza, Bonobo, Kygo, and other electronic artists. All of their logos had a few themes in common, such as:</p>
      <ul class="josh-list">
        <li class="item1">an architectural or geometric element;</li>
        <li class="item1">subtle fonts;</li>
        <li class="item1">and a minimal style that isn't overly distracting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creative Brainstorm</h3>
      <h2>Getting initial thoughts out</h2>
      <p>At this point in the design process it was time to get all of my ideas onto the computer. After looking at other logos, I began playing with different forms of Josh's name. I knew he would want something unique, so I really pushed myself to think creatively and think outside of the box.</p>

      <h3>Logo Refinement</h3>
      <h2>Feedback from a professional</h2>
      <p>At this point I had my logo explorations reviewed by a senior graphic designer who was interested in my use of the upside down letters, but told me to keep iterating on the theme. I took his advice and made some adjustments before coming up against the three day deadline imposed by 99 Designs.</p>

        <h3>Typeface</h3>
        <h2>Simple and clean</h2>
        <p>Roboto is a versatile and modern font that works well for music because of its neutrality. It's quiet but also has a style of it's own.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="final-josh-1">
        <h3>Final Product</h3>
        <h2>A culmination of feedback and iteration.</h2>
        <p>Out of 80 competing designs, this design was selected by the DJ. I also highlighted the potential for this logo to be used for video productions during his sets. This dynamic logo is able to adapt to a wide array of media.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>An important lesson I learned during this contest was not giving up when you have an inclination. I almost gave up on this contest and didn't submit, but I had a feeling that I knew what the client wanted. Being able to see my competitor's designs, I thought they misunderstood the project brief.</p>
