        <h2>01 Summary</h2>
        <p>I worked with a fictional client that wanted to move into the cloud storage and organization market. There were a few key features they knew they wanted, but I would need to back up these claims with data. It was up to me to refine this rough vision and begin developing a user-friendly cloud storage platform.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>02 Problem</h2>
        <p>What features does the platform need to fit into the already crowded cloud storage and organization market?</p>
        <br>
        <h2>03 Solution</h2>
        <p>For the final product, I designed a cloud storage platform that would allow users to create documents and spreadsheets, upload files, and share these files with friends and colleagues. The product is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

    <h2>08 User Stories</h2>

  <div class="container-fluid stories1">
    <p>After creating the personas and using the data from the survey, I was able to create the user stories. I organized these by role, task, and value, and then sorted them according to their priority level. For the MVP I decided to focus on account creation, document creation, document organization, and file adding. This decision was based on user data that pointed to user’s most necessary features. Here is a snapshot of the <b>high-priority stories</b> for the "user" role:</p>

      <p>I tested the wireframes with three different users, and had a few important takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Would need to add a clear “Add” button in future iterations. Users were unclear on 	where to add new content.</li>
        <li>The flow for organizing a document was unclear. I would need to make it clear 	where users can organize a document once they’re inside.</li>
        <li>Users expect confirmation pages after upgrading their plans.</li>
        <li>Confusing navigation on the left side of the dashboard.</li>

  <div class="container-fluid branding">
    <!--should all H2s be in their own row?-->
    <h2>11 Logo & Branding</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid branding1">
    <p>I used mind mapping and word association to come up with different images and feelings for the brand name. I settled on IdeaDesk, which I thought captured both the creativity and productivity associated with the platform I was designing. With the name in mind, I went on to create various forms of the logo:</p>
    <div class="row concept">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>I wanted to give a sense of cluttered papers on a desk, since these are the rough forms of ideas. I started by sketching different stacks of papers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 logo">
        <img src="SVGs/Group 23.svg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row refinements">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h3>Refinements</h3>
        <p>I took the sketches into Figma and started playing around with different arrangements and shadows. I thought the primary font was powerful, so I wanted to keep the logo fairly simple. I experimented with placing the text in different areas, and liked how the papers overlapped with “Idea.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 logo">
        <img src="SVGs/Group 33.svg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row refinements">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h3>Final Logo</h3>
        <p>For the final logo I put I changed the colors of the papers to make the design more inviting and playful. The papers on the left represent chaotic ideas, as if they’re coming out of a box. The final design is simple yet bold.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 logo">
        <img src="SVGs/Logo Horizontal.svg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The IdeaDesk color palette focuses on white and greys with bright pops of color. The palette brings a sense of fun and spontaneity to the brand.</p>

    <h2>12 Mockups & Testing</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid testing">
    <p>I conducted 2 remote and one in-person test the desktop and mobile designs. During this round of testing, I wanted to get feedback but also hone my user testing skills. I worked on letting users have freedom in the product instead of directing them with verbal cues too much. This allowed me to get more insightful feedback that would shape future iterations of the product in important ways.</p>
    <div class="row pricing">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Old Landing 2.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Landing Page new1 3.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>While conducting user testing I received feedback that the original pricing view (left) was difficult to read. After a few iterations, I created the final pricing view (right). This view incorporates checkmarks in order to reduce reading and uses strategic color in order to guide the user through the information.</p>
    <div class="row add-menu">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Add Folder 1.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Dash Add [new].png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>For the add file dropdown, I recevied feedback from users that this menu would be easier to navigate if there were icons. I learned an important lesson here that designers should aim to provide visual aids in order to help the user. This is also helpful for people whose don't speak English as their first language.</p>
    <div class="row add-menu-mobile">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Mobile Upload2 Old.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="images/Dashboard Mobile Add New.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>I used preference testing to decide between these two views, and 90% of users preferred the native iOS view on the right. I learned here that keeping native design reduces cognitive load for the user because they're seeing visual cues that they already recognize.</p>

    <h2>13 Final Product</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid final-product1">

      <h3 class="row">What did I learn?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Always save iterations of work for case studies.</li>
          <li>Sketches and wireframes should be thorough and neat. These 	need to be detailed in order to clearly communicate with 	stakeholders early on and conduct successful initial testing.</li>
