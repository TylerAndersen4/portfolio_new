    <h3>People and Places</h3>
    <p> I’m fascinated by cultures, places, and languages. In high school I learned Spanish, and then in college, studied Italian and French. This fascination led me to study abroad for a year in Italy during school. After graduating, I moved to Buenos Aires to teach English and after that taught English at a public school outside of Paris. Before moving back to LA where I am now, I lived in Brooklyn while working for a tech startup in the Manhattan. While living in these different cities, I  spent a lot of time traveling to nearby places and learning about different ways of life. I immersed myself by studying the local language and living my day-to-day life in it.</p>

    <h3>Visuals</h3>
    <p>Looking at the ads has always been my favorite part of reading Vogue. I ripped out and saved my favorite ones, and looking back now, can see how some of these images became the basis for my personal aesthetic. Aside from the ads, I spend time every season watching the runway shows from my favorite designers. The Avante-Garde work of designers like Miuccia Prada and Alexander Mcqueen completely reconfigured my understanding of what functional design is and can be. </p>

    <h3>Creativity</h3>
    <p>I started painting on 18 x 24” canvases that I would buy in bulk from the art store. As I grew up, I started doing larger pieces on plywood that my dad didn’t need anymore. His garage became my studio as I experimented with spraypainting Craigslist personals quotes across the surfaces. When I started traveling it wasn’t feasible to bring paint supplies, so I moved toward writing, photography, and digital collage. Aside from painting, last year I published two pieces of creative writing in an LA-based arts magazine, with a third piece coming this year in the same magazine. This latest piece will be accompanied by my friend’s paintings and is an exploration of artistic creation and gender identity. </p>

    <h3>So how does this all come together?</h3>
    <p> With my interest in people, languages, and visual design, I thought about a career in UX. I wanted to do something “creative” that also involved people, and after working at a startup I knew I wanted to stay in the tech industry. In the same way with fashion, I’m drawn to the high energy and constant iteration of tech. I believe that people and experiences come into our life when we need them, and UX appeared to me at a time when I needed direction and focus. So far it’s been a meaningful and challenging experience, and I’m excited about where it’s going.</p>
