      <h3>People and Places</h3>
      <p>I’m fascinated by cultures and languages. Throughout high school and college I studied Spanish, Italian, and French. My fascination with other ways of living led me to study abroad for a year in Italy during school. After graduating, I moved to Buenos Aires to teach English and after that taught English at a public school outside of Paris. After that I lived in Brooklyn while working for a tech startup in Manhattan. While living in these different cities, I  spent a lot of time
      traveling to nearby places and learning about different ways of life. I immersed myself by studying the local language and living my day-to-day life in it.</p>

      <h3>Visuals</h3>
      <p>Looking at the ads has always been my favorite part of reading Vogue. I ripped out and saved my favorite ones, and looking back now, can see how some of these images became the basis for my personal aesthetic. Aside from the ads, I spend time every season watching the runway shows from my favorite designers. The ugly/beautiful, Avante-Garde work of Miuccia Prada and Alexander Mcqueen completely reconfigured my understanding of what functional design is and can be. </p>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>I started painting on 18 x 24” canvases that I would buy in bulk from the art store. As I grew up, I started doing larger pieces on plywood that my dad didn’t need anymore. His garage became my studio as I experimented with spraypainting Craigslist personals quotes across the surfaces. When I started traveling it wasn’t feasible to bring paint supplies, so I moved toward writing, photography, and digital collage.</p>

      <h3>So how does this all come together?</h3>
      <p>With my interest in people, languages, and visual design, I thought about a career in UX. I needed a creative role and after working at a startup I knew I wanted to stay in the tech industry. So far UX has been an ideal fit for my skills and interests, and I'm excited about where this new path is going to take me.</p>
