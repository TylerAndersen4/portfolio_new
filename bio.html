    <h3>People and Places</h3>
    <p>I’m fascinated by cultures, places, and languages. In high school, I learned Spanish, and then in college, I studied Italian and French. This fascination led me to study abroad for a year in Italy during school. After graduating, I moved to Buenos Aires to teach English and after that taught English at a public school outside of Paris. Before moving back to LA where I am now, I lived in Brooklyn while working for a tech startup in the Manhattan. While living in these different cities, I spent a lot of my free time meeting new people, exploring museums and traveling in the region. I decided to live, work, and study in these places instead of just traveling to them because I wanted to truly experience the local lifestyle and way of thinking.</p>

    <h3>Visuals</h3>
    <p>Looking at the ads has always been my favorite part of reading Vogue. I rip out and save my favorite ones in various folders, and looking back now, can see how some of these images became the basis for my personal aesthetic. Aside from the ads, I spend time every season watching the runway shows from my favorite designers. Although I’ve never been able to afford their clothes, the avante-garde work of designers like Miuccia Prada, Martin Margiela, and the late Alexander Mcqueen completely reconfigured my understanding of what functional design is and can be.</p>

    <h3>Creativity</h3>
    <p>I’ve painted since I was little. I started on 18 x 24” canvases that I would buy in bulk from the art store. As a I grew up, I started doing larger pieces on plywood that my dad didn’t need anymore. His garage became my studio as I experimented with garishly spraypainting quotes from Craigslist Personals across the plywood. Last year I discovered that I could do digital paintings which would save space and resources. I’m working now with overlaying quotes over random creative commons images, especially religious iconography. Aside from painting, last year I had two pieces of creative writing published in an arts magazine based in LA. I’ll have my third piece published this year in the same magazine. The piece will include my writing accompanied by my friend’s watercolor paintings. The writing is an exploration of the act of artistic creation and gender identity.</p>

    <h3>So how does this all come together?</h3>
    <p>With my interest in people and languages, along with my affinity for visual design, I thought about a career in UX. I wanted to do something “creative” that also involved people, and after working at a startup I knew I wanted to stay in the tech industry. In the same way with fashion, I’m drawn to the high energy and constant iteration of tech. I believe that people and experiences come into our life when we need them, and UX appeared to me at a time when I needed direction and focus. So far it’s been one the best challenges, and I’m excited about where it’s going.</p>
