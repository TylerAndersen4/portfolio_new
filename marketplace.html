        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h4>What is Marketplace?</h4>
        <!-- <h2>What is Marketplace?</h2> -->
        <p>Marketplace is a curated online collection of independent fashion designers. As consumers become more aware of the environmental and humanitarian costs of fast fashion, they're becoming increasingly interested in local and/or sustainable clothing.</p>
        <h4>Solving the Initial Problem</h4>
        <!-- <h2>The invisible cost.</h2> -->
        <p>Clothing production requires a huge amount of resources and chemicals. The current demand for low-cost and low-quality clothing comes at the expense of factory workers, cotton farmers, and the environment. These are just a few of the ways the apparel industry is damaging:</p>
          <ul class="list1">
            <li class="item1">Chemicals used to grow cotton in developing countries end up polluting local water supplies and are cancerous to the farmers who come into contact with them daily.</li>
            <li class="item1">Clothing made abroad means a larger carbon footprint when these clothes are shipped overseas to their markets.</li>
            <li class="item1">Low-quality clothing that is meant to deteriorate creates a wasteful (and profitable) cycle of buying and disposing.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <!-- <h2>Fashion meets tech.</h2> -->
        <p>Marketplace connects consumers to independent designers that they wouldn't discover in major online retailers. Shoppers can save their favorite pieces and designers to get updates when new items become available.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <h4>Testing the waters.</h4>
      <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">I started with a hypothesis: consumers are interested in ethical and sustainable clothing, but have limited options for finding it. I needed to test the waters first and see if people would even be interested in the type of platform I had in mind. I saw a market gap that Etsy doesn't fill, which is where the initial idea started. The survey was completed by over 40 participants. View the survey and see the key data in the charts below.</p>
      <h4>Key Questions:</h4>
      <ul class="list-questions">
        <li>Are you interested in local and independent fashion designers?</li>
        <li>Where do you primarily shop for clothing?</li>
        <li>How often do you shop for clothing online?</li>
        <li>How much more are you willing to spend for sustaibly-produced clothing?</li>
        <li>What is your opinion on fast fashion (ex. H&M, Zara, Forever 21)?</li>

      <h4>Interpreting the user research.</h4>
      <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">The results of my research were eye-opening and at times, contradictory. Consumers seem very interested in ethical and sustainable clothing, but the data also shows that they are not currently buying this clothing. Consumers, as seen in the chart below, are also willing to spend more for sustainable and humanely-produced clothing. The results confirmed my hypothesis that there is a market gap that is not currently being filled.</p>
      <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">If you knew that a piece of clothing was produced with fair wages, safe working conditions, and environmentally-friendly materials, how much more would you be willing to spend on it?</p>

From the data and these conversations, I gained a clear perspective into what these customers want and the issues they face with the platforms that exist currently. There were several themes that were repeated by different users, which I made my main areas of focus going forward with personas and product decisions. These are:</p>
      <ul class="list1">
        <li class="item1">Easy search and filtering features in order to narrow down available options, especially by size.</li>

        <li class="item1">Users were less interested in location-based search than I expected, and I decided it would be best to stick to a traditional e-commerce model.</li>

      <div class="conclusion-mkt-inner1">
        <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
        <p class="col-sm-10 bio-intro">The process of designing Marketplace was both rewarding and challenging. I had the opportunity to build a platform that I believe could truly make a difference in the world, all while learning more about how different retailers craft their digital experiences. So, after all of this, what were my main takeaways?</p>
        <ul class="col-sm-10 next-steps">
          <li class="item1">Testing design ideas early on will save time later at the wireframe and visual design stage. To that end, I would have liked to have done more paper prototyping, but it was difficult for me to find participants.</li>
          <li class="item1">One of the most important things I learned during this process is the importance of solid user personas. User goals should align with the high priority user stories that appear on the platform, and user frustrations should be based on actual user interviews.</li>
          <li class="item1">It's hard to find the balance between minimal and overkill with branding. I learned during this process that it's helpful to start with a logo, and then let the color palette evolve from there. I actually had to iterate through two color palettes before I settled on something that worked.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="conclusion-mkt-inner2">
        <h4>What are the next steps for Marketplace?</h4>
        <ul class="col-sm-10 next-steps">
          <li class="item1">Design pages for return users, including favorite lists and curated landing page views.</li>
          <li class="item1">Talk with fashion designers to get their input on the platform. From there, I'd like to create an admin dashboard where designers can control their shop.</li>
